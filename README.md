#Raspberry Pi 2
This is a repo for my uncle's raspberry pi 2.

#Why?
We're working on a quad rotor helicopter.
If you would like to provide input, my email is EverettDW13@gmail.com

#How?
We're using an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi 2 to make the helicopter.
Hopefully it'll be done in time for a science fair I'm interested in entering the helicopter in.
That isn't the reason I'm doing it though.
I'm trying to learn more about technology and this seemed to be the best way to go about it.
